TransEquilibrium
================

[TransEquilibrium](https://github.com/barisione/transequilibrium/) is a Twitter bot which translates a user's tweets back and forth between English and Japanese until the translation is stable, that is translating the tweet further is not going to change it any more.

The idea comes from [TranslationParty](http://www.translationparty.com/), but is applied to Twitter.

[@reTrumplation](https://twitter.com/reTrumplation), translating Donald Trump's tweets, is the reason this bot was written.

**What's the point?**<br/>
There's no point.

**Why Japanese?**<br/>
I thought other languages, like Russian, could be more fun, but Japanese seems to be the worst translated language, which gives the funnier results.

**Who are you?**<br/>
[This is me](http://www.barisione.org/).

**What do you use to translate text?**<br/>
The Microsoft Azure Translator API which is behind Bing Translator.

**Why Bing instead of Google?**<br />
Because Bing is free and because Google translations are better (so less fun).

**Something the bot said is offensive or inappropriate**<br />
Sorry. ðŸ˜ž<br />
Unfortunately this is unavoidable with a bot that works automatically.
