TransEquilibrium
================

TransEquilibrium is a program which translates a user's tweets back and forth between English and Japanese until the translation is stable, that is translating the tweet further is not going to change it any more.

The idea comes from [TranslationParty](http://www.translationparty.com/) but is applied to Twitter.

[@ReTrumplated](https://twitter.com/ReTrumplated), translating Donald Trump's tweets, it the main use for this program.
