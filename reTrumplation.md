reTrumplation
=============

[@reTrumplation](https://twitter.com/reTrumplation) is a Twitter bot which translates Donald Trump's tweets back and forth, sometimes achieving a funny result (and sometimes not).

This bot is implemented using [TransEquilibrium](https://github.com/barisione/transequilibrium/).

If any tweet is offensive or inappropriate, I'm sorry. This is just an effect of automatica translation. Contact me and I will remove the tweet.
